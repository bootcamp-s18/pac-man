‚ÄúI leave Sisyphus at the foot of the mountain. One always finds one's burden again. But Sisyphus teaches the higher fidelity that negates the gods and raises rocks. He too concludes that all is well. This universe henceforth without a master seems to him neither sterile nor futile. Each atom of that stone, each mineral flake of that night-filled mountain, in itself, forms a world. The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy.‚Äù

‚Äï Albert Camus

SUMMARY:

Pac-man is a 2-dimensional game in which a sentient yellow circle with a mouth compulsively eats smaller yellow circles, whilst navigating through an endless maze.  As Pac-man navigates the passages of his maze, eating ‚Äúpellets‚Äù, he is haunted by the spectre of four colored ghosts who wish to end his Sisyphean existence by killing him through their touch.  In each maze, there are four flashing pellets of a larger size than regular pellets.  These ‚Äúpower pellets‚Äù give Pac-man invulnerability to the ghost touch attack, and at lower levels he gains the ability to consume his spectral pursuers for a limited time.  Pac-man gains points for destroying the ghosts while in power pellet mode, visually cued by a change in ghost color to a unanimous deep blue.  He also gains points for eating regular pellets, power pellets, and fruits.  After earning ten thousand points, Pac-man can gain an additional life until he reaches a maximum of five concurrent lives. Once all pellets on a level are consumed, the screen will flash four times and the maze resets.  When the maze resets, Pac-man returns to his starting position, the ghosts return to their pin, and the pellets repopulate the maze.  As levels progress, the maze layout changes and the red ghost will move faster.  The final level is 256.  This is the ‚Äúkill level‚Äù because the game runs out of memory.  On level 256, the game loads half of a normal map with the right half corrupted.  The final level is impossible to complete. A cruel joke or an allegory for the impossibility of nirvana?

Who is Pac-man? Why does he eat pellets? Why do the four ghosts pursue him?  Does Pac-man destroy his own universe at level 256, only to see it reborn anew?  It is possible that Pac-man himself does not know, but we can attempt to gain personal understanding through observation of his ceaseless performance of destruction and rebirth.


PAC-MAN (the man)

Pac-man is yellow and circular. His mouth opens and closes continuously.  He initially moves slightly faster than the ghosts.  He begins each level moving to the left.  He will move forward until he hits a wall.  When he hits a wall, he will face the wall and his mouth will continue to open and close, but he will not move in any direction.  Even when not moving, Pac-man will be pursued by the ghosts.  He must continue to move and to eat, or he will perish and his torment will start anew. 

Pac-man is controlled by a player using directional buttons, tied to the arrow keys on a standard QWERTY keyboard. The directions in which Pac-man can move are: UP (towards the top of the maze), RIGHT (towards the right edge of the maze), DOWN (toward the bottom of the maze), and  LEFT (toward the left edge of the maze). The player can que a move for Pac-man to make at the next opportunity that the move is allowed to happen.  As an example: Pac-man is moving RIGHT, bound on top and bottom by walls.  If the user selects UP using the up-arrow key, Pac-man will move UP at the next break in wall to his upward direction.

When Pac-man dies, the game will stop for a moment.  Pac-man will open his mouth until his body disappears and he pops out of existence.


THE MAZE:

The maze is black, with blue lines outlining the boundaries and walls of the maze.  The maze is filled with pellets, with the exception of the spaces immediately surrounding the ghost pin. The spot immediately below the ghost pin, opposite of the pin opening, will see fruits randomly generate twice a level. The maze has two openings in the middle of its outer boundaries, mirrored on the left and right sides.  These are false glimmers of hope for escape.  They will simply transport Pac-man from opening to its opposite.  The ghosts can also use these transport openings.


PELLETS:

The number of pellets will change as the maze layout changes with each progressive level.  Pellets give Pac-man ten (10) points when consumed.  Unconsumed pellets do not count against or towards Pac-man‚Äôs score when he is killed.  When Pac-man restarts a level after death, consumed pellets are not replaced within the maze. 


POWER PELLETS:

There are four (4) power pellets per level.  At lower levels, power pellets allow Pac-man to eat ghosts.  At higher levels,  power-ups granted to Pac-man by consuming power pellets only grant invulnerability to Pac-man from ghost attacks.  The duration of this power-up is decreased at higher levels.  When Pac-man is powered-up, ghost turn a deep blue and move at half speed.  The ghosts will move in the opposite direction of Pac-man when vulnerable. Before they return to their normal state, the ghosts will flash white and blue for a short time.  At higher levels, this transition period will decrease in duration.

At the lower levels in which Pac-man can consume the ghosts, he gains a static amount of points for consumed ghosts.  These points compound by a factor of two as he consecutively consumes each of his four ghost adversaries within a single power-up instance.  The first ghost grants 200 points, 400 points for the second ghost, 800 points for the third ghost, and 1600 points for the final ghost.  There is a moment of delay for both Pac-man and the ghosts when he consumes them.  The only thing that moves at this time is the disembodied eyes of the consumed ghost.  This mode can be entered four (4) times during a single level, since there are four (4) power pellets Pac-man can consume.  
Once consumed, the eyes of the ghosts will flee Pac-man‚Äôs gullet and sprint at double ghost movement speed towards the ghost pin.  They are unaffected by the time stop that occurs when their corporeal form is destroyed within Pac-man‚Äôs ravenous maw.  Within the ghost pin, their bodies are restored and they begin their chase anew, unaffected by Pac-man‚Äôs power-up if it is still active, even if their kin are still affected.  The power pellets serve as the cruel, ephemeral equalizer in Pac-man‚Äôs dance of death with the colored demons that ceasely dog his very existence.  


ENEMIES:
	
Color:  Red, Pink, Cyan, Orange
Personality: Chaser, Ambusher, Fickle, Feigned Ignorance
Nickname: Blinky, Pinky, Inky, Clyde

Blinky begins each level outside of the ghost pin.  Pinky immediately exits the pin, followed after moment of time by Inky and then Clyde.  Blinky will generally go towards the upper right corner of the maze, Pinky will tend towards the upper left, Inky towards the bottom left, and Clyde towards the bottom right.

Each ghost has a different personality.  Blinky will aim to chase behind Pac-man until he can catch him.  Pinky will aim for a point in front of Pac-man in order to ambush him.  Inky and Clyde are more random in their approach and are hard to predict what behavior they will adopt.  At times, they will flee from Pac-man even if he is not in power-up mode. At other times, they will adopt a more active behavior, mimicking Blinky and Pinky in behavior for a time.  This can change dynamically within the duration of a single level.  

The ghost have variable speeds.  As the levels progress, Blinky will get faster.  The other ghosts will have different speeds as each level begins, but are usually slower than the speed of Pac-man.  They all move at half speed when vulnerable and at double speed when fleeing to their pin as eyes. The ghost will look in the direction of their movement.  This means their pupils will travel to the top, right, bottom, and left sides of their eyeballs as they travel in those directions.   


SCORING (points, fruit, extra lives):

Pellets award 10 points
Power pellets award 50 points
Consumed ghosts grant 200, 400, 800, and 1600 points consecutively within a single power-up instance
Fruits award variable points: 
üçí Cherry: 100 points.
üçì Strawberry: 300 points
üçä Orange: 500 points
üçé Apple: 700 points
üçà Melon: 1000 points
 Galaxian Boss: 2000 points
üîî Bell: 3000 points
üîë Key: 5000 points
Extra lives are awarded every 10,000 points with a maximum limit of 5 lives


LEVELS AND DIFFICULTY CURVE:

Maze layout changes every level, predictably.  Level two will always have the same maze layout.  Difficulty increase is tied to the movement speed of the ghosts and to the decreasing duration of power-up mode for Pac-man.


TERMINOLOGY:

Within the code for Pac-man, there are naming conventions used to reference certain aspects of the game.  

The prefix ‚ÄòPac‚Äô generally refers to an element that references some aspect of Pac-man himself.  

The maze is generated using a tile system.  Any reference to ‚Äútile‚Äù, ‚Äúmap‚Äù, ‚Äúrender‚Äù, etc.. will be in reference to the construction of the maze itself.
